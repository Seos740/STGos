# StanleyOS

Welcome to StanleyOS, an operating system built around the power and simplicity of low-mode and high-mode scripting. StanleyOS is designed to give you full control over hardware with low-mode while providing simplicity and flexibility with high-mode scripts, all tailored to the unique **Stanley the Great** experience.

## Overview

StanleyOS is a pre-built custom operating system that comes with two modes:
- **Low-mode**: Direct access to the hardware with full control over the system's resources. Ideal for users who need precise hardware manipulation.
- **High-mode**: A more user-friendly environment that abstracts low-level complexities, allowing for easier development with high-level commands. High-mode scripts are automatically converted to low-mode for maximum control when necessary.

The high-mode interpreter is built within low-mode, making it easy to transition between the two as needed.

## Features

- **Low-mode for hardware control**: Direct access to the systemâ€™s hardware for advanced users.
- **High-mode for simplicity**: Write high-level scripts for easier development. These can be automatically converted into low-level operations.
- **Dual-mode conversion**: High-mode scripts can be converted to low-mode for efficient performance.
- **Pre-built OS**: StanleyOS is already built and ready to go, so you can start exploring immediately.

## Getting Started

To get started with StanleyOS, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- A x64 environment (bare-metal or emulator).
- An emulator like **QEMU** or **Bochs**.
- The **StanleyOS** disk image file.

### Running StanleyOS

StanleyOS is pre-built and ready to run! To get started, you simply need to boot from the pre-built image.

1. Download the `stanleyos.img` file from the releases page.
2. Run the OS on your preferred emulator (e.g., **QEMU**, **Bochs**) or create a bootable USB drive.

To run StanleyOS in **QEMU**, use the following command:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive file=stanleyos.img,format=raw


This will boot into the system, where you can begin running **low-mode** and **high-mode** scripts.

## Writing Scripts

### Low-mode Script (Assembly)

Low-mode scripts are written directly in assembly and are ideal for advanced users who want control over hardware. 

High-mode Script (StanleyScript)
High-mode scripts are written in StanleyScript, a custom language designed for simplicity. Below is an example of printing "Hello, Stanley!" to the screen:


print("Hello, Stanley!")

High-mode scripts are converted to low-mode for execution when needed, combining the ease of high-level scripting with the power of low-level hardware control.
